			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In August 2006, at the age of 16, I purchased my first Mac during a summer job as a dishwasher. Thankfully, my parents agreed to help fund the purchase. Before that, I always had a PC at home due to my dad's work in computer distribution. My parents believed in developing my computer skills, and so I remember having a PC in my bedroom since kindergarten.</p><img class="hero" src="https://laurentboileau.com/assets/photos/my-first-mac-box.jpg" alt="Picture of the author posing with a 20-inch iMac box on a kitchen table" title="My First Mac: Author and Box" /><p>In the mid-2000s, the iPod caught my interest, leading me to explore Apple's products. I remember visiting a family friend who owned an iMac G5. It was without a doubt the best computer I had ever seen. The sleek design and rich operating system convinced me to switch to the Mac.</p><p>After a summer of hard work spent in the back of a restaurant, I was finally able to afford my first Mac: a 20-inch iMac. It opened my eyes to a whole new world of computing. It was such a joy to use compared to my crappy hand-me-down Pentium III where I was limited to three Firefox tabs (or two when Winamp was playing audio). Mac OS X's attention to detail was unmatched. Everything was fast, approachable and fun.</p><img class="hero" src="https://laurentboileau.com/assets/photos/my-first-mac-desk.jpg" alt="Picture of a 20-inch iMac's back sitting on a desk" title="My First Mac: Back of iMac on Desk" /><p>I've now been a Mac user for most of my life. It's my ultimate joy machine. I've never had as much fun using computers as I do when using a Mac. Whether I'm browsing the web in Safari, listening to music or developing software, using a Mac always feels great and pleasurable. The potential for creation, discovery and entertainment seems endless. I hope I can continue to use a Mac for many decades to come.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm proud to have introduced <a href="https://stationsmontreal.app">Stations</a> <a href="https://laurentboileau.com/posts/introducing-stations-for-iphone">earlier today</a>.</p><p>This milestone marks the start of my independent journey on the App Store.</p><p>While I do have a decade of professional work experience, this is the first app I’ve entirely funded, designed, developed, and released on my own.</p><p>Shipping has never felt this satisfying.</p><img class="hero" src="https://laurentboileau.com/assets/photos/developing-stations.jpg" alt="Development tasks at the time of launch" title="Developing Stations" /><h3>Business model</h3><p>Stations <em>currently</em> is a paid app.</p><p>I plan to eventually migrate to a free with a subscription model, but I believe that paid is better suited <em>at the moment</em>.</p><p>The current version has a complete, albeit limited feature set. There are features in the roadmap that are well suited for subscriptions, but I'm not there yet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ucXAlmC1-0">I work slowly</a>.</p><p>Additionally, I'm still finding my indie bearings and I don't want to be overwhelmed with support requests.</p><p>This is a labor of love project that I work on in my spare time. Ideally, I shouldn't have to justify charging for work but here we are.</p><h3>Future</h3><p>An effort was made to keep <a href="https://stationsmontreal.app/release-notes/1.0.html">1.0</a> lean. Otherwise, there's no telling when (or if) I would've shipped.</p><p>That version is a launchpad and I've got a good backlog to work with.</p><p>My goal is to have fun making a well-maintained app that's a good platform citizen.</p>]]></content:encoded>
