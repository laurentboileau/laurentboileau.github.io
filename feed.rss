There are features in the roadmap that are well suited for subscriptions, but I'm not there yet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ucXAlmC1-0">I work slowly</a>.</p><p>Additionally, I'm still finding my indie bearings and I don't want to be overwhelmed with support requests.</p><p>This is a labor of love project that I work on in my spare time. Ideally, I shouldn't have to justify charging for work but here we are.</p><h3>Future</h3><p>An effort was made to keep <a href="https://stationsmontreal.app/release-notes/1.0.html">1.0</a> lean. Otherwise, there's no telling when (or if) I would've shipped.</p><p>That version is a launchpad and I've got a good backlog to work with.</p><p>My goal is to have fun making a well-maintained app that's a good platform citizen.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://laurentboileau.com/posts/introducing-stations-for-iphone</guid><title>Introducing Stations for iPhone</title><description>Stations is your personal Montreal metro assistant.</description><link>https://laurentboileau.com/posts/introducing-stations-for-iphone</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://stationsmontreal.app">Stations</a> is your personal Montreal metro assistant.</p><p style="text-align: center;">
