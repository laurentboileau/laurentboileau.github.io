						<h2>My First Mac</h2></header>
<p>In August 2006, at the age of 16, I purchased my first Mac during a summer job as a dishwasher. Thankfully, my parents agreed to help fund the purchase. Before that, I always had a PC at home due to my dad's work in computer distribution. My parents believed in developing my computer skills, and so I remember having a PC in my bedroom since kindergarten.</p><p>In the mid-2000s, the iPod caught my interest, leading me to explore Apple's products. I remember visiting a family friend who owned an iMac G5. It was without a doubt the best computer I had ever seen. The sleek design and rich operating system convinced me to switch to the Mac.</p><img class="hero" src="/assets/photos/my-first-mac.jpg" alt="Picture of a 20-inch iMac box on a kitchen table" title="My First Mac" /><p>After a summer of hard work spent in the back of a restaurant, I was finally able to afford my first Mac: a 20-inch iMac. It opened my eyes to a whole new world of computing. It was such a joy to use compared to my crappy hand-me-down Pentium III where I was limited to three Firefox tabs (or two when Winamp was playing audio). Mac OS X's attention to detail was unmatched. Everything was fast, approachable and fun.</p><p>I've now been a Mac user for most of my life. It's my ultimate joy machine. I've never had as much fun using computers as I do when using a Mac. Whether I'm browsing the web in Safari, listening to music or developing software, using a Mac always feels great and pleasurable. The potential for creation, discovery and entertainment seems endless. I hope I can continue to use a Mac for many decades to come.</p>
