I'm proud to have introduced [Stations][stations] [earlier today][earlier].

This milestone marks the start of my independent journey on the App Store.

While I do have a decade of professional work experience, this is the first app Iâ€™ve entirely funded, designed, developed, and released on my own.

Shipping has never felt this satisfying.

### Business model

Stations *currently* is a paid app.

I plan to eventually migrate to a free with a subscription model, but I believe that paid is better suited *at the moment*.

The current version has a complete, albeit limited feature set. There are features in the roadmap that are well suited for subscriptions, but I'm not there yet. [I work slowly][yt].

Additionally, I'm still finding my indie bearings and I don't want to be overwhelmed with support requests.

This is a labor of love project that I work on in my spare time. Ideally, I shouldn't have to justify charging for work but here we are.

### Future

An effort was made to keep [1.0][1] lean. Otherwise, there's no telling when (or if) I would've shipped.

That version is a launchpad and I've got a good backlog to work with.

My goal is to have fun making a well-maintained app that's a good platform citizen.
